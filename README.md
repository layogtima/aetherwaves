**Make eerie, ethereal music with your bare hands through this no-touch instrument. Perfect for aspiring electronic musicians, sci-fi enthusiasts, and anyone who's ever wanted to look like they're casting spells while making music!**

## ‚ú® What is √ÜTHERWAVES?

√ÜTHERWAVES is a browser-based virtual theremin that uses hand tracking to let you create music by moving your hands in the air. Unlike traditional theremin instruments that use physical antennas, √ÜTHERWAVES uses your webcam and machine learning to track your hand movements, allowing you to control pitch, volume, and timbre with gestures.

Think of it as the digital lovechild of a theremin and a Kinect, wrapped in a [MONO aesthetic](https://mono.layogtima.com/).

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Visit [https://aether.layogtima.com/](https://aether.layogtima.com/) in a web-standard compliant browser (e.g. Safari does NOT work for the moment :()
2. Allow camera access when prompted
3. Click "INITIATE THEREMIN" to begin
4. Position your hands in view of the camera:
   - Left hand (cyan aura): Controls pitch
   - Right hand (magenta aura): Controls volume
5. Move your hands to create sounds:
   - Moving left hand horizontally changes pitch
   - Moving right hand vertically changes volume
   - Rotating your palm adds modulation

## üíª System Requirements

- Modern web browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox and Edge recommended)
- Webcam
- Decent lighting for optimal hand tracking
- Recommended: Computer with dedicated GPU for smoother performance

## üéÆ Controls

### Hand Gestures

- **Pitch Control**: Move your left hand horizontally (left = low pitch, right = high pitch)
- **Volume Control**: Move your right hand vertically (down = low volume, up = high volume)
- **Palm Rotation**: Adds additional modulation to sound

### UI Controls

- **Waveform Select**: Choose between sine, triangle, sawtooth, and square waves
- **Reverb**: Adjust the amount of reverb effect
- **Filter**: Control the cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter
- **Visualization Options**: Toggle various visual elements:
  - Show Landmarks: Display hand tracking points
  - Show Connectors: Display lines connecting hand landmarks
  - Show Coordinates: Display position information
  - Show Audio Aura: Display glowing auras around hands
- **Hand Tracking**: Enable/disable smoothing for more stable tracking

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **T**: Toggle theremin on/off
- **D**: Toggle debug panel

## üîÆ Features

- **Hands-free Music Creation**: Control sound parameters using only hand movements
- **Dual Hand Control**: Left hand controls pitch, right hand controls volume
- **Visual Feedback**: See your hands tracked with color-coded landmarks
- **Audio Visualization**: Real-time waveform display
- **Customizable Sound**: Choose from different waveforms (sine, triangle, sawtooth and square)
- **Audio Effects**: Adjustable reverb and filter settings
- **Detailed Hand Tracking**: MediaPipe-powered hand landmark detection
- **Audio Auras**: Visual representation of the sounds you're creating
- **Debug Mode**: For those who want to see what's happening under the hood

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (over CDN, no build tooling needed!)
- **Hand Tracking**: [MediaPipe Hands](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html)
- **Audio Synthesis**: [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## üîç Debug Features

Toggle the debug panel to see:

- Hand position coordinates
- Detected landmark positions
- Current frequency and volume values
- Palm rotation angle
- FPS counter

## üéµ Music Theory Notes

√ÜTHERWAVES is tuned to a chromatic scale from C2 (65.41 Hz) to C6 (1046.50 Hz). The pitch mapping is exponential rather than linear, which makes it more musically intuitive.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Tips for IDEAL Performance

1. **Lighting**: Ensure your hands are well-lit for better tracking
2. **Contrast**: Perform against a plain background for best results
3. **Distance**: Position yourself about 2-3 feet from the camera
4. **Practice**: Start with slow, deliberate movements
5. **Explore**: Try different hand positions and rotations
6. **Record**: Capture your performance with screen recording software

## üîÑ Planned Features

- [ ] Multiple theremin modes
- [ ] Additional audio effects
- [ ] Scale/mode selection
- [ ] Recording and export functionality
- [ ] Touch device support
- [ ] Multiple user collaboration

## üëæ Known Issues

- Safari is not supported yet
- Hand tracking may be less reliable in poor lighting conditions
- Performance may vary based on system capabilities
- Mobile support is limited
